##  Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for stock market price analysis, which builds an LSTM-based predictive model to forecast future stock prices. It uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, technical analysis, and deep learning for accurate predictions.


### Key Objectives

* Data Collection: Download real stock data from Yahoo Finance

* Exploratory Analysis: Visualize price movements, volume, and trends

* Technical Analysis: Compute moving averages and trading indicators

* Risk Analysis: Measure volatility and risk using statistical methods

* Machine Learning: Build an LSTM neural network for price prediction

* Evaluation: Test and compare prediction accuracy with real data

### Features

1. Fetch real-time historical stock data
2. Perform EDA with charts and insights
3. Calculate technical indicators (Moving Averages, Volatility)
4. Model future stock prices using LSTM
5. Evaluate accuracy with RMSE and visualization



### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SharonneKemboi/STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION/blob/main/stock_analysis_explained.ipynb)

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button above
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Customize stock tickers in the configuration section

### Option 2: Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SharonneKemboi/STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION.git
cd STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook stock_analysis_explained.ipynb
```

##  Dependencies

```txt
yfinance>=0.2.12
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
scikit-learn>=1.1.0
tensorflow>=2.8.0
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

Easily customize your analysis by modifying these parameters:

```python
# Stocks to analyze
TICKERS = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']

# Date range for analysis
START = '2020-01-01'
END = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Prediction settings
TARGET = 'AAPL'      # Stock to predict
TIME_STEP = 60       # Days of history to use
```

## Features & Analysis

### 1.  Stock Price Analysis
- Historical price visualization with moving averages
- Trend analysis and pattern identification
- Multi-timeframe technical indicators

### 2.  Trading Volume Analysis
- Volume patterns and anomaly detection
- Normalized volume comparison across stocks
- Volume-price relationship analysis

### 3.  Risk Assessment
- **Volatility Analysis**: Annualized standard deviation
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Maximum expected loss at 95% confidence
- **Conditional VaR**: Expected loss during worst-case scenarios
- **Correlation Matrix**: Inter-stock relationship analysis

### 4.  LSTM Prediction Model
- Sequential neural network architecture
- 60-day lookback window for pattern recognition
- Dropout layers for overfitting prevention
- Model validation and performance metrics

### 5.  Performance Evaluation
- Multiple accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Directional accuracy assessment
- Comparison with naive baseline models
- Error distribution analysis

##  Sample Results

### Model Performance (AAPL Example)
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| MAE | $2.45 | Average prediction error |
| RMSE | $3.21 | Root mean square error |
| MAPE | 1.8% | Mean absolute percentage error |
| Directional Accuracy | 67.3% | Correct up/down predictions |

### Risk Analysis Summary
```
Stock Volatility Analysis:
‚Ä¢ AAPL: 28.5% annual volatility (Medium Risk)
‚Ä¢ MSFT: 24.1% annual volatility (Low-Medium Risk)
‚Ä¢ TSLA: 45.2% annual volatility (High Risk)
```

##  Disclaimers & Limitations

###  Investment Disclaimer
**This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions.**
- Stock markets are inherently unpredictable
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Always consult qualified financial advisors
- Never invest money you cannot afford to lose

###  Technical Limitations
- **Simplified Model**: Real trading algorithms are far more complex
- **Limited Features**: Only uses price/volume data (missing news, fundamentals)
- **Market Regime**: Model may not adapt to changing market conditions
- **Survivorship Bias**: Analysis only includes currently listed stocks
